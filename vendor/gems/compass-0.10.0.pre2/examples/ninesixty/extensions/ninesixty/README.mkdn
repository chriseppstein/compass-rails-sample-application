* Port of Version 1.0
* 2008-03-24

Created by Nathan Smith. See the official site for more info: <http://960.gs/>

---------

This plugin adds the 960 Grid System framework to [Compass](http://compass-style.org/).

Install
=======

    sudo gem install chriseppstein-compass
    sudo gem install chriseppstein-compass-960-plugin

Create a 960-based Compass Project
==================================

    compass -r ninesixty -f 960 <project name>

Then edit your `grid.sass` and `text.sass` files accordingly. A reset is added into grid.sass automatically.

Customizing your Grid System
============================

To create a grid system with other number of columns use the `+grid-system` mixin to generate
the corresponding classes.

Example:

    #wrap
      +grid-system(24)

Making Semantic Grids
=====================

* Use the `+grid-container` mixin to declare your container element.
* Use the `+grid` mixin to declare a grid element.
* Use the `+alpha` and `+omega` mixins to declare the first and last grid elements for a row.
* User the `+grid-prefix` and `+grid-suffix` mixins to add grid columns before or after a grid element.

Example:

    #wrap
      +grid-container
      #left-nav
        +alpha
        +grid(5,16)
      #main-content
        +grid-prefix(1,16)
        +grid(10, 16)
        +omega
