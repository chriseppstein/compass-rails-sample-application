// Here is where you can define your constants for your application and to configure the blueprint framework.
// Feel free to delete these if you want keep the defaults:

!blueprint_grid_columns = 24
!blueprint_container_size = 950px
!blueprint_grid_margin  = 10px

// Use this to calculate the width based on the total width.
// Or you can set !blueprint_grid_width to a fixed value and unset !blueprint_container_size -- it will be calculated for you.
!blueprint_grid_width   = (!blueprint_container_size + !blueprint_grid_margin) / !blueprint_grid_columns - !blueprint_grid_margin
