  Welcome to Compass.
  In this file you should write your main styles. (or centralize your imports)
  Import this file using the following HTML or equivalent:

@import compass/reset.sass

/*
  The *:focus rule is reset and suppresses link outlining.
  You _must_ remember to redefine your own outline, as itâ€™s an important accessibility aid. E.g.
  *:focus
    outline: #ccc dotted medium
