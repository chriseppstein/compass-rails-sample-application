Congratulations! Your compass project has been created.
You must recompile your sass stylesheets when they change.
This can be done in one of the following ways:
  1. From within your project directory run:
     compass
  2. From any directory run:
     compass -u path/to/project
  3. To monitor your project for changes and automatically recompile:
     compass --watch [path/to/project]

        end
        puts "\nTo import your new stylesheets add the following lines of HTML (or equivalent) to your webpage:"
        puts stylesheet_links
      end

      def compilation_required?
        true
      end
